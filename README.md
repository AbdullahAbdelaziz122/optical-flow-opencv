# Optical Flow with OpenCV

This repository contains implementations and visualizations of various **Optical Flow** algorithms using OpenCV in Python. Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames. It's a foundational technique in computer vision tasks such as motion tracking, video analysis, and autonomous navigation.

## üìπ Algorithms Implemented

- [x] **Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow**
- [x] **Farneback Dense Optical Flow**
- [ ] DeepFlow / RLOF (Planned)
- [ ] Real-time Optical Flow with webcam (Planned)

## üß™ Features

- Image and video input
- Real-time webcam support
- Custom visualization overlays (e.g. flow lines, color maps)
- Adjustable hyperparameters
- Save and compare outputs

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for optional visualizations)

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
